## 📜 Lore

In the far reaches of a forgotten land, there lies a deep, ancient cavern called **Echo Hollow** — a place where every sound lingers, and every action resonates through time.

You are the last of the Seekers, drawn to the Hollow by visions and whispers. As you mine, the cavern reacts — not just with dust and stone, but with ancient echoes: voices from a lost world, secrets buried beneath centuries of silence.

You are not just mining.  
You are awakening something.
